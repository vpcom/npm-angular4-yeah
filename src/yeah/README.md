# Angular4 Yeah

The component just prints `Yeah!`.

It demonstrates the most simple npm component for an Angular4 application. But not only, it goes along a [Github project](https://github.com/vpcom/npm-angular4-yeah) built simply with Angular-CLI that contains the project for npm and the standard project to test it.
